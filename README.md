# BDS-RL
This repository includes the tutorial material for the Tinbergen Institute/Business Data Science course 'Reinforcement Learning' in 2024-2025.

## Tutorials
### Tutorial 0
This tutorial provides an introduction to R, R markdown, and tinytex. We will **not** discuss this tutorial in class.

### Tutorial 1
In this tutorial, you will implement two concepts:
  - &epsilon;-greedy algorithm
  - Regret calculation
The Yahoo data can be found in the 'tutorial 1' folder.

### Tutorial 2
In this tutorial, you will implement two concepts to solve multi-armed bandits problems:
  - Thompson sampling
  - Upper-confidence bound
The Yahoo and ZoZo data can be found in the 'tutorial 2' folder.

### Tutorial 3
In this tutorial, we will consider contextual bandits. In particular, you will implement the linear UCB method that uses additionally observed information to maximize rewards. You will apply the linear UCB on cryptocurrency data. The data can be found in the 'tutorial 3' folder.

### Tutorial 4
This tutorial discusses Markov decision processes. As an example of a Markov decision process, you will implement an algorithm that performs the Tic Tac Toe game.

### Tutorial 5
This tutorial consists of two parts:
  - A discussion on Q-learning.
  - You will implement an algorithm for an agent that uses Q-learning to learn (i) to find the exit in a building, and (ii) to find the shorthest part between nodes.

# See you in class!
